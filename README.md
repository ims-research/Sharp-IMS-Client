================

Basic IMS Client written in C#

This project forms part of a larger investigation into Dynamic Service Orchestration in the IP Multimedia Subsystem.

Audio / video support has been re-enabled, but is still under development.

There is no documentation available at the moment, but rough documentation is underway. Please leave some feedback if you are interested in the project.
